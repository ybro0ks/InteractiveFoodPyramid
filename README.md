# InteractiveFoodPyramid

The	Food	Pyramid	shows	how	much	of	what	you	eat	overall	should	come	from	each	shelf	to	achieve	
a	healthy,	balanced	diet.	The	shape	of	the	Food	Pyramid	shows	the	types	of	foods	and	drinks	people	
need	 to	 eat	most	 for	 healthy	 eating.	 It	 is	 divided	 into	 six	 shelves	 and	 each	 provides	 you	 with	 the	 range	of	nutrients	and	energy	needed	for	good	health.	Healthy	eating	is	all	about	choosing	the	right	
amounts	from	each	shelf.	
An	interactive	Food	Pyramid	allows	you	to	record	the	number	of	foods	consumed	in	any	given	day	by	
categorising	and	recording	the	food	types	for	each	shelf.
